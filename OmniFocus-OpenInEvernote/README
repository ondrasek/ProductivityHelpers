OmniFocus-OpenInEvernote.scpt
Version 0.1
$id$

A simple script to propagate projects / groups from OmniFocus as tags in
Evernote.

The goal is to enable tracking notes, such as meeting minutes or thoughts /
ideas in Evernote in relation to particular Projects or Groups in OmniFocus.
When the script is executed, it does this:

1. Determines the currently selected task in OmniFocus.
2. Scans the task title to scan for a tag name in square brackets. If tag name
is not found, the script terminates.

Example:
[project-tag] My Special Task Group -> leads to project-tag being created in
Evernote

3. Locates a parent task of the current task (possibly a project or a parent
group) and scans it for a tag in square brackets. If no tag is found, the entire
name is taken as the tag name.
4. Creates tags for current task and its parent if they don't exist.
5. Opens up Evernote and displays all notes associated with the tag.
6. If there are no notes, it creates a new one. If there are already some notes,
the script asks the user whether to create a new note or not.
